      <h2>Understanding Neural Networks with a Real-Life Scenario</h2>
      <p>Imagine you are in a village where no one has ever seen a car before. Your task is to train a group of people to recognize a car when they see one. But instead of looking at the whole car, you decide to break the task into smaller parts and assign each person a specific job, just like neurons in a neural network.</p>
      <h3>Step 1: Dividing the People into Subgroups (Like Neural Layers)</h3>
      <p>Since no one knows what a car looks like, we divide the people into smaller teams based on what part of the car they should focus on. Each person will specialize in detecting just one part:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Person A → Focuses only on the tyres</li>
            <li>Person B → Focuses only on the headlights</li>
            <li>Person C → Focuses only on the body</li>
        </ul>
      <p>Each of them will return a score between 0 and 1, indicating how sure they are that they found that feature.</p>
      <h3>Step 2: Weighting the Features (Like Hidden Layers Processing Information)</h3>
      <p>Now, we have different probability scores, but not all parts are equally important. So, we assign another person (Person D) the job of weighting these features based on their importance.</p>
      <p>Final Score = (0.8 × 0.3) + (0.4 × 0.5) + (0.9 × 0.9) = 1.25</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Making the Final Decision (Like the Output Layer)</h3>
        <p>Finally, the last person, Person X, looks at the total score and decides if the object is a car or not.</p>

        <h3>Learning and Improvement (Like Backpropagation)</h3>
        <p>If Person X makes mistakes, we adjust the weights to improve future decisions.</p>
